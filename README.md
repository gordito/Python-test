# Python-test

Added some lines to add PDF print support

## Dependencies

To run this code you need an external library called PyFPDF

Install it with pip. If you don't have pip, you need to install it first.


## Install PIP

Donwload https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

Run it with python in terminal as a super user:

`cd /go/to/download/dir`

`sudo python get-pip.py`


## Install PyFPDF

`sudo pip install fpdf`


## Run the code

The code should now work :)
